# Neural Magic's DeepSparse MLPerf Submission

This is the repository of Neural Magic's DeepSparse submission for [MLPerf Inference Benchmark v3.0](https://www.mlperf.org/inference-overview/).

## BERT Results

In this submission, we show two different methods of optimizing BERT-Large by combining various methods of compression covering: unstructured gradual pruning, quantization-aware training, and structural distillation. 

Maintaining >= 99% of the original BERT-Large F1 score and using the [DeepSparse Engine](https://github.com/neuralmagic/deepsparse), we show it is possible to:
- Compress the FP32 dense weights by orders of magnitude from 1.3 GB to 10 MB.
- Improve performance **1000x** from 5 samples/sec to >5000 samples/sec!

Our MLPerf Inference v3.0 submission contains the following results for the BERT-Large SQuAD v1.1 question answering task:

| Benchmark      | Engine  | Precision | Compressed File Size | SQuAD v1.1 F1 Score (R=X% of Base Accuracy) |  Offline Throughput [samples/sec]  |
|:----------------:|:-----------:|-----------:|:-----------:|:------:|:-------:|
| [BERT-Large Baseline](https://zenodo.org/record/3733910) | ONNXRuntime | FP32 | 1.3 GB   | 90.874 (R=100.00%)	| 4.60     |
| [oBERT-Large 99%](obert_large.md)                        | DeepSparse  | INT8 | 38.2 MB  | 90.03 (R=99.07%)	  | 1367.14  |
| [oBERT-MobileBERT 99.9%](obert_mobilebert.md)            | DeepSparse  | INT8 | 19.45 MB | 90.80 (R=99.92%)	  | 3275.62  |
| [oBERT-MobileBERT 99%](obert_mobilebert.md)              | DeepSparse  | INT8 | 9.56 MB  | 90.41 (R=99.49%)	  | 5578.73  |

The benchmark implementation and models are stored in the [code/bert](code/bert) directory which contains a `README.md` detailing instructions on how to set up the benchmark. An example of the commands used to generate this submission is stored in [submission.md](submission.md).

## ResNet50 Results

In this submission, we show how to optimize a ResNet50 model from [Torchvision](https://pytorch.org/vision/stable/models.html) trained on the [Imagenet 2012 dataset](https://image-net.org/challenges/LSVRC/2012/) by combining unstructured gradual pruning and quantization-aware training with [SparseML](https://github.com/neuralmagic/sparseml) and [DeepSparse](https://github.com/neuralmagic/deepsparse). 

Maintaining >= 99% top1 validation accuracy of the baseline model, we show it is possible to:
- Compress the FP32 dense weights from 97.7 MB to 11 MB.
- Improve performance **13x** from 1.4k samples/sec to almost 20k samples/sec!

Our MLPerf Inference v3.0 submission contains the following results for the ResNet50 ImageNet 2012 classification task:

| Benchmark      | Engine  | Precision | Compressed File Size | ImageNet 2012 Top1 Accuracy (R=X% of Base Accuracy) |  Offline Throughput [samples/sec]  |
|:----------------:|:-----------:|-----------:|:-----------:|:------:|:-------:|
| [ResNet50 Baseline](https://zenodo.org/record/4735647/) | ONNXRuntime | FP32 | 97.7 MB  | 76.456% (R=100.00%)	| 1488.4   |
| [ResNet50 99%](resnet50.md)                             | DeepSparse  | INT8 | 11.0 MB  | 75.712% (R=99.02%)	| 19632.1  |

The benchmark implementation and models are stored in the [code/resnet50](code/resnet50) directory which contains a `README.md` detailing instructions on how to set up the benchmark. An example of the commands used to generate this submission is stored in [submission.md](submission.md).

The benchmarks were evaluated using a server with two 4th Gen AMD EPYC 9654 (Genoa) CPUs with 96 cores each.
